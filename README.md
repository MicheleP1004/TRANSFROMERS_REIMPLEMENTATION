# TRANSFROMERS_REIMPLEMENTATION

This project aims at reimplementing a simpler version of the transformer architecture proposed in the article [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) in PyTorch.

The final objective is to understand transformer architectural bases and fundamental aspects of Machine Learning pipeline (preprocessing, training, testing, results interpretation).
